# Orinoco

Welcome to my project Orinoco !<br/><br/>
This is the 5th project into my web developer training.<br/>
This project includes Front-end and API for a webshop.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites, just enjoy !

### Installing

Open your command line / shell from the root folder and bundle the JS dynamic files.

```
npm run build
```

Then listen the API server and the front-end on your localhost.<br/>
The server will listen on the port 3000, the front-end listen to the localhost available.

```
npm start
```

## Deployment

Please be aware of the localhost port number used by your local machine when deploy the front.<br/>
You can easily find it on your command line / shell.
